 using machine learning to solve a regression problem

If you want to open this project on your device you should follow these steps:
1- Open the "veri toplama" file and run it on jupyter notebook
(if you don't have a jupyter notebook then you might be need to download the anaconda navigator app)
2- When you run that code the bicycle data is now saved in excel
3- Run "on isleme" from "algoritmalar" and now we did the feature selection part
4- Save your best model and with "servisleme" you are good to go.
Enjoy!
